ðŸ‘‰ Richard Feldman gave [a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1FU3e0sT1I)
to explain the principles I used to build this. I highly recommend watching it!

> [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API and uses [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).


### [Demo](https://rtfeldman.github.io/elm-spa-example)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Demo with Time-traveling Debugger](https://rtfeldman.github.io/elm-spa-example-with-debug)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

For more information on how this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

Check out [the full writeup](https://dev.to/rtfeldman/tour-of-an-open-source-elm-spa)!

# Getting started

If you don't already have `create-elm-app`:

> npm install -g create-elm-app

Then, to build everything:

> elm-app build

See more information in the [User Guide](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app/blob/master/template/README.md) for Create Elm App.
